# What our project is all about?

- The Decentralized Election System (DES) is a user-friendly website designed to conduct fair and online elections based on blockchain.

- It allows the Registration of Voters, Political parties, and candidates for Indian elections. It will enable Candidate Registration according to the constituency, and Voters can vote anonymously during the election phase. Finally, after completing the election, we will compute and publicly display the results on our web App.

- We utilize the fundamental concepts of blockchain, like immutability, security, transparency, to achieve our goals like counting votes correctly and conducting transparent and secure voting.
